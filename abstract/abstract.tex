\maketitle  

P-values and confidence intervals are two common summaries used when performing inference on a parameter. However, many statisticians have criticized this paradigm since it subjectively dichotimizes results by fixing a level of significance. Confidence distributions solve this issue by displaying information for all levels of significance. From a confidence distribution, one can find point estimates, one-sided and two-sided p-values, one-sided and two-sided confidence intervals, power for any null hypothesis, and the counternull. Our research involves creating an exact confidence distribution for rare event meta-analyses.
