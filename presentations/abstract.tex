\title{Confidence distributions in meta analysis}

\maketitle  

P\hyph{}values and confidence intervals are two common ways of performing hypothesis tests and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimation. However, many statisticians have criticized this paradigm, since it subjectively dichotimizes results. Confidence distributions are an easy way to display point estimates, one-sided p-values, two-sided p-values, and confidence intervals for any level of $\alpha$. In our research, we will explore ways to use confidence distributions for an exact approach to rare event meta-analysis.
